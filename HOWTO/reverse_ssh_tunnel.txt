HOW TO "Reverse ssh tunnel"

let suppose you want to login to computer 'C1' behind NAT router
using any accesible-through-network ssh server on 'S1'. 

this can be done via ssh following next steps,
note, you need ssh user accounts 'usernameC1' on C1 and 'usernameS1' on S1,
and root access to S1.

1. Configure ssh server on S1, add to 'sshd_config':
   GatewayPorts yes
and restart service sshd

give access to chosen port number 'P1' (for example, 6012) for firewall of S1
(in redhat: edit /etc/sysconfig/iptables and restart service iptables)

2. run on C1:
   ssh -nNT -R S1:P1:localhost:22 usernameS1@S1
then type your password for usernameS1@S1

3. now you can login to C1 from any computer using this command:
   ssh usernameC1@S1 -p P1

P.S. if something goes wrong, run sshd server with debug option '-d'
