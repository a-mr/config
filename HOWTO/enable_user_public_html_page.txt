1. find and set these lines in apache config:
<IfModule mod_userdir.c>
    #
    # UserDir is disabled by default since it can confirm the presence
    # of a username on the system (depending on home directory
    # permissions).
    #
#    UserDir disabled

    #
    # To enable requests to /~user/ to serve the user's public_html
    # directory, remove the "UserDir disabled" line above, and uncomment
    # the following line instead:
    # 
    UserDir public_html

</IfModule>

#
# Control access to UserDir directories.  The following is an example
# for a site where these directories are restricted to read-only.
#
<Directory /home/*/public_html>
    AllowOverride FileInfo AuthConfig Limit
    Options MultiViews Indexes SymLinksIfOwnerMatch IncludesNoExec
    <Limit GET POST OPTIONS>
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
    </Limit>
    <LimitExcept GET POST OPTIONS>
        Order deny,allow
        Deny from all
    </LimitExcept>
</Directory>

2. set permissions for ~/public_html was accessible by apache
In case of Fedora/RHEL SELinux should be configured:
[bash]# setsebool -P httpd_enable_homedirs true
[bash]# chcon -v -R -h -u user_u -t httpd_user_content_t /home/*/public_html


3. Adding area restricted by password:
htpasswd -c /etc/httpd/passwords    $USERNAME
chown apache:apache /etc/httpd/passwords
chmod u=rw,go= /etc/httpd/passwords

In apache config:

<Directory /home/*/public_html/restricted>
    AuthType Basic
    AuthName "Restricted Files"
    AuthUserFile /etc/httpd/passwords
    Require user   $USERNAME
</Directory>
